For this post, I am excluding lsp and autocompletion plugins. This post will mainly focuses on the plugins improved the daily workflow.\nyazi.nvim # yasi is terminal file manager of choice. Unlike other terminal file manager like ranger and lf, yazi is written rust making it much faster compared to its alternatives. So yazi.nvim allows to integrate yazi with neovim.\nmikavilpas/yazi.nvim A Neovim Plugin for the yazi terminal file manager Lua 359 11 lazygit.nvim # lazygit.nvim is the wrapper plugins for lazygit allowing the user to perform all the git operation right from the neovim.\nkdheepak/lazygit.nvim Plugin for calling lazygit from within neovim. Lua 1381 53 telescope.nvim # telescope.nvim is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. Built on the latest awesome features from neovim core. Telescope is centered around modularity, allowing other plugins to utilize the telescope as their UI for inputs.\nnvim-telescope/telescope.nvim Find, Filter, Preview, Pick. All lua, all the time. Lua 15189 813 neorg # When it comes to note taking, my previous choice was vimwiki. However, since I started using neovim, I was looking for better alternatives and this is when I came across neorg on reddit. Neorg is an all-encompassing tool based around structured note taking, project and task management, time tracking, slideshows, writing typeset documents and much more. The premise is that all of these features are built on top of a single base file format (.norg), which the user only has to learn once to gain access to all of Neorg\u0026rsquo;s functionality.\nnvim-neorg/neorg Modernity meets insane extensibility. The future of organizing your life in Neovim. Lua 6255 210 undotree # Being developer, making changes in the program is quite daily routine and after a lots of changes it is hard to keep track of it. This is where undotree comes into picture. Undotree visualizes the undo history and makes it easy to browse and switch between different undo branches. They\u0026rsquo;re a feature of Vim that allow you to go back to a prior state even after it has been overwritten by later edits.\nmbbill/undotree The undo history visualizer for VIM Vim Script 3815 100 nvim-surround # Surround selections, stylishly üòé Yes, this is the line you will see on its github readme. nvim-surround does really makes working with around characters like ([{'\u0026quot; buttery smooth.\nkylechui/nvim-surround Add/change/delete surrounding delimiter pairs with ease.
