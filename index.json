While GUI applications have their place, nothing beats the speed, efficiency, and sheer control that CLI tools provide. Over time, Iâ€™ve experimented with countless terminal tools, but some have truly stood out and become essential to my workflow.\nIf you live in the terminal like I do, youâ€™ll love these tools. Letâ€™s dive in!\nneovim # I started with Vim like many others, fascinated by its modal editing and sheer efficiency. But then came Neovim, and everything changed. Neovim takes Vimâ€™s legacy and modernizes it with:\nAsynchronous Plugins \u0026amp; LSP Support â€“ Seamless auto-completion and real-time linting. Embedded Terminal Emulator â€“ Run commands without switching windows. Lua-Based Configuration â€“ More power and flexibility than Vimscript. If you love Vim but crave better extensibility and modern features, Neovim is a must-have.\nðŸ”¹ My Workflow: I use Neovim as my primary code editor, writing scripts, editing configs, and even drafting blog posts like this one. With plugins like telescope.nvim and lualine.nvim, my setup feels snappy and efficient.\nfzf # You know that frustrating moment when you need to find a file, but you canâ€™t remember the exact name? Thatâ€™s where fzf comes in. Itâ€™s an interactive fuzzy search tool that makes finding files, directories, and commands effortless.\nWhy I Love It: # Blazing fast fuzzy searching. Works inside Vim, bash, and even scripts. Integrates with find, rg, fd, git, and more. ðŸ”¹ Example: Quickly locate files interactively:\nfind . -type f | fzf I have fzf mapped in my shell to make directory navigation insanely fast. Trust me, once you start using it, thereâ€™s no going back!\ntmux # I used to open multiple terminal tabs and windows until I discovered tmux. It changed how I work in the terminal forever. tmux allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions inside a single window.\nWhy Itâ€™s Essential: # Persistent Sessions â€“ Never lose work due to accidental disconnections. Split Panes \u0026amp; Windows â€“ Organize multiple tasks efficiently. Highly Configurable â€“ Customize keybindings, colors, and layouts. ðŸ”¹ Example: Start a new session:\ntmux new -s mysession Now, I can work on multiple projects without worrying about losing my place.\nyazi # If youâ€™ve ever used ranger, lf, or nnn, youâ€™ll love yazi. Itâ€™s a minimal, keyboard-driven file manager that feels like a dream to use.\nWhy Itâ€™s a Game-Changer: # Lightning-fast navigation. Preview support for images, PDFs, and videos. Lua-based customization for ultimate flexibility. ðŸ”¹ How I Use It: I use yazi to quickly browse files, especially when dealing with large projects. Its preview feature saves me from opening unnecessary files.\nlazygit # Git is powerful, but letâ€™s be honestâ€”it can be a pain to use from the command line, especially when managing branches and resolving conflicts. lazygit changes that with an intuitive and interactive Git UI for the terminal.\nWhy You Need It: # Effortless commit, push, pull, rebase, and stash operations. Visual branch management and conflict resolution. Lightweight and fast. ðŸ”¹ Example: Launch lazygit inside a Git repo:\nlazygit I rely on lazygit whenever I need to handle complex merges or review commits without typing out long Git commands.\ntaskwarrior # Staying productive isnâ€™t just about writing codeâ€”itâ€™s about organizing your work efficiently. taskwarrior is an advanced task manager for the command line.\nWhy I Use It: # Prioritization and due dates keep me on track. Recurring tasks and dependencies ensure nothing slips through the cracks. Powerful filtering and custom reports. ðŸ”¹ Example: Add a high-priority task:\ntask add \u0026#34;Write blog post\u0026#34; due:tomorrow priority:H I use taskwarrior to track my work and personal tasks without relying on GUI-based to-do apps.\nzoxide # Typing cd repeatedly is inefficient, and thatâ€™s where zoxide shines. It learns your frequently visited directories and lets you jump to them instantly.\nðŸ”¹ Example: Quickly navigate to a frequently accessed directory:\nz project This tool saves me so much time, eliminating the need to type long directory paths.\nWrapping Up # These tools have become an essential part of my daily workflow. Whether Iâ€™m coding, managing files, or organizing tasks, they help me stay efficient and focused. If you spend a lot of time in the terminal, I highly recommend giving them a try.\nðŸ’¬ What are your favorite command-line tools?

In this post, I will be talking about the top 10 neovim plugins which I used on daily basis. For this post, I am excluding lsp and autocompletion plugins. This post will mainly focuses on the plugins improved the daily workflow.\nyazi.nvim # yasi is terminal file manager of choice. Unlike other terminal file manager like ranger and lf, yazi is written rust making it much faster compared to its alternatives. So yazi.nvim allows to integrate yazi with neovim.\nmikavilpas/yazi.nvim A Neovim Plugin for the yazi terminal file manager Lua 1204 43 lazygit.nvim # lazygit.nvim is the wrapper plugins for lazygit allowing the user to perform all the git operation right from the neovim.\nkdheepak/lazygit.nvim Plugin for calling lazygit from within neovim. Lua 1985 77 telescope.nvim # telescope.nvim is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. Built on the latest awesome features from neovim core. Telescope is centered around modularity, allowing other plugins to utilize the telescope as their UI for inputs.\nnvim-telescope/telescope.nvim Find, Filter, Preview, Pick. All lua, all the time. Lua 18092 908 neorg # When it comes to note taking, my previous choice was vimwiki. However, since I started using neovim, I was looking for better alternatives and this is when I came across neorg on reddit. Neorg is an all-encompassing tool based around structured note taking, project and task management, time tracking, slideshows, writing typeset documents and much more. The premise is that all of these features are built on top of a single base file format (.norg), which the user only has to learn once to gain access to all of Neorg\u0026rsquo;s functionality.\nnvim-neorg/neorg Modernity meets insane extensibility. The future of organizing your life in Neovim. Lua 6993 230 undotree # Being developer, making changes in the program is quite daily routine and after a lots of changes it is hard to keep track of it. This is where undotree comes into picture. Undotree visualizes the undo history and makes it easy to browse and switch between different undo branches. They\u0026rsquo;re a feature of Vim that allow you to go back to a prior state even after it has been overwritten by later edits.\nmbbill/undotree The undo history visualizer for VIM Vim Script 4342 116 nvim-surround # Surround selections, stylishly :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: Yes, this is the line you will see on its github readme. nvim-surround does really makes working with around characters like ([{'\u0026quot; buttery smooth.\nkylechui/nvim-surround Add/change/delete surrounding delimiter pairs with ease.
